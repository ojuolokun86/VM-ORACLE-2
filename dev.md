# Development Notes

## Project: BMM DEV V2 - WhatsApp Multi-Instance Bot

### Backend

- **User Authentication**
  - Registration and login endpoints using Express and Supabase.
  - Passwords are hashed with bcrypt.
  - Unique 6-digit `auth_id` generated for each user.
  - Duplicate email registration is handled gracefully.

- **Bot Deployment**
  - `/api/deploy-bot` endpoint accepts `authId`, `phoneNumber`, `country`, and `pairingMethod`.
  - Registration and deployment logic separated into `deployment.js`.
  - Registration flow emits QR code or pairing code to the frontend via **Socket.IO** (migrated from native WebSocket).
  - After successful registration, `startBmmBot` is called to start the user’s WhatsApp session.
  - Each user session is isolated and managed for performance and low memory usage.
  - Session directories are structured as `/sessions/{authId}/{phoneNumber}` to support multiple bots per user.

- **Socket.IO Integration**
  - Dedicated `socket.js` handles Socket.IO server setup and user/bot-specific event emission.
  - Live QR code, pairing code, and status updates are sent to the correct user/bot in real time.
  - Frontend registers each bot session with `{authId, phoneNumber}` for targeted event delivery.

- **Session Management**
  - Each user’s WhatsApp session uses its own folder for credentials.
  - On disconnect:
    - If reason is `badSession`, `loggedOut`, or `Failure`, the session is deleted and not restarted.
    - For other reasons (e.g., `connectionClosed`, `restartRequired`), the bot is automatically restarted.
  - Cleanup and error handling ensure unused sessions are closed and memory is freed.
  - On server startup, all existing sessions in the `/sessions` directory are auto-started.

### Frontend

- **Modern UI**
  - All pages use a unified, mobile-friendly, modern card-based design (`style.css`).
  - Responsive layouts for dashboard, login, register, and deploy pages.

- **Authentication**
  - Login and registration forms use email and password.
  - Session info (`authId`, `email`) is stored in `sessionStorage` for dashboard and deployment use.

- **Bot Deployment Page**
  - Custom country dropdown with flag, search, and code, populated from API or local JSON.
  - Phone number input is validated and formatted for WhatsApp (E.164, no `+`).
  - Pairing method selection (QR code or pairing code).
  - On deploy, the frontend connects to the backend via **Socket.IO** to receive live QR or pairing code and status updates.
  - Pairing code display is now styled with a glowing/shining effect and clear instructions for the user.

- **Socket.IO Client**
  - Each user connects to the backend Socket.IO server and registers their bot session.
  - UI updates in real time as registration progresses, showing QR or pairing code and status.

---

**All code is modular:**  
- CSS in `style.css`  
- JS per page (e.g., `deploy.js`)  
- Backend logic split by responsibility (auth, deployment, Socket.IO, bot session)

**Focus:**  
- Fast, scalable, and memory-efficient multi-user, multi-bot WhatsApp automation.

---

### Backend

- **Session Persistence**
  - Switched from file-based sessions to a single SQLite database (`sessions.db`) using `better-sqlite3`.
  - All WhatsApp session credentials and keys are stored and loaded from the database.
  - On startup, all sessions in the database are loaded and bots are started automatically.

- **Bot Lifecycle**
  - `startBmmBot` loads session from SQLite and starts a Baileys socket for each bot.
  - Robust disconnect handling:
    - If disconnect reason is `badSession`, `loggedOut`, `Failure`, or custom code `405`, the session is deleted from SQLite and not restarted.
    - For other disconnect reasons (`connectionClosed`, `restartRequired`, etc.), the bot is automatically restarted.
  - Each bot instance is tracked in a `sessions` map for fast access and cleanup.
  - `deleteBmmBot` and `stopBmmBot` handle session removal and cleanup.

- **Message Handling**
  - All incoming messages are routed through a central `handleMessage` function.
  - Features include anti-link detection (`antiLink.js`) and command handling (`commandHandler.js`).
  - Commands like `.ping` and `.echo` are supported.

- **Bot Manager**
  - `botManager.js` tracks all active bot instances by phone number for easy management.

- **Startup Logic**
  - On server start, the app ensures the `database` directory exists, then loads all sessions from SQLite and starts bots for each.

---

### Frontend

- **Modern UI**
  - Stylish, mobile-friendly input fields for login and registration.
  - Consistent card-based design across all pages.
  - Pairing code display is glowing and easy to read.

- **Authentication**
  - Login and registration forms use email and password.
  - Session info (`authId`, `email`) is stored in `sessionStorage` for dashboard and deployment use.

- **Bot Deployment**
  - Users can deploy bots by providing phone number and pairing method (QR or pairing code).
  - Frontend receives live QR or pairing code and status updates via Socket.IO.

---

### Infrastructure

- **Socket.IO**
  - Real-time communication for registration, QR/pairing code, and status updates.
  - CORS is configured for both REST and Socket.IO endpoints.

- **Docker/Deployment**
  - `.env` and Dockerfile setup for environment variables and deployment.
  - Ensures database directory exists before SQLite is used.

---

**Summary:**  
- All session data is now in SQLite for reliability and speed.
- Bots auto-load from the database on startup.
- Codebase is modular, robust, and ready for multi-user, multi-bot scaling.

# Development Notes (Day 3)

## What We Have Done (Not Yet in Dev Note)

---

### BMM Manager (Load Manager Layer)

- **Built a BMM Manager (middleware/proxy) between frontend and backend bot servers.**
  - Proxies all REST API and Socket.IO traffic.
  - Handles room-based event routing for QR and pairing codes.
  - Caches last QR/pairing code per session for reliable delivery.
  - Health monitoring for backend bot servers (HTTP and Socket.IO checks).
  - Load balancing logic for assigning users/bots to backend servers.

- **Socket.IO Event Delivery**
  - Ensures frontend joins the correct session room (`authId:phoneNumber`) before deployment.
  - LM receives backend events (`backend-event`) and emits to the correct frontend room.
  - Added detailed logging for all event flows (backend → LM → frontend).
  - Fixed race condition where frontend missed events by joining room before deploy.

- **Frontend Improvements**
  - Dashboard lists all bots for the logged-in user, each clickable to view details.
  - Added `bot.html` and `bot.js` for per-bot info display.
  - Improved error handling and user feedback for deploy and registration flows.
  - Ensured session info (`authId`, `email`) is always stored and used for API calls and Socket.IO.

- **Backend Improvements**
  - All backend event emissions (`emitToBot`) now include both `authId` and `phoneNumber` for precise routing.
  - Unified event naming and payload structure for QR, pairing code, and status.
  - Added logs for every emission and event received by LM.

- **Reliability**
  - Fixed all issues where QR/pairing code was not delivered to frontend.
  - Ensured frontend always joins the room before backend emits events.
  - Added caching and replay of last QR/pairing code on reconnect.

---

### Summary

- **BMM Manager** now reliably proxies and delivers all bot events to the correct frontend session.
- **Frontend** and **backend** are fully decoupled and communicate only via the manager.
- **All event delivery is robust, race-condition free, and logged for debugging.**
- **User experience:** Bots are listed, deploy is reliable, and QR/pairing code always displays correctly.
